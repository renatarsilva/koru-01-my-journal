          <h2>Rediscovering Technology</h2>
          <p>
            Today I stopped to think about how much my relationship with
            technology has changed over the years. It used to be just curiosity,
            now it feels like purpose. Leaving administration and diving into
            development has been challenging but incredibly rewarding. Every
            line of code I understand feels like a small victory. I finally feel
            like I’m on the right path, even when I stumble sometimes.

          <h2>Busy Days, Full Heart</h2>
          <p>
            Life has been hectic. Classes in the morning, nonprofit project in
            the afternoon, and ForjaDev moderation at night. Still, I’m happy. I
            feel useful and connected to people who share the same dreams. Sure,
            I get tired sometimes, but then I remember I’m building something
            I’ve always wanted. That thought gives me energy to keep going, even
            on the tough days.

          <h2>Melhorzin and the Power of Community</h2>
          <p>
            We had a Melhorzin meeting today and I left feeling inspired. What
            started as a small group wanting to help each other has grown into a
            real community. We’re building open source projects, learning
            together, and supporting one another. I feel proud knowing that I’m
            helping create a space where developers grow, feel seen, and build
            real impact.

          <h2>Starting Over Isn’t Easy</h2>
          <p>
            Some days I ask myself if changing careers was the right move.
            Leaving behind seven years of experience and stability wasn’t
            simple. But when I look at everything I’ve learned and the projects
            I’ve been part of, I see growth. I’m no longer stuck—I’m evolving.
            Starting over is scary, but it brings life with it. And that’s what
            keeps me going.
